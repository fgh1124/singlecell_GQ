# singlecell_GQ
Single cells from embryos of PD and PDCO on IVC day 2 were harvested to generate RNA-seq data and compared to the natural embryos of E4.5 for analysis. The raw files were processed with Cell Ranger using the default mapping arguments. Gene expression analyses and cell-type identifications were performed using Seurat V3.1.
